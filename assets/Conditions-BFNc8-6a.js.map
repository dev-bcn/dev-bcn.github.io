The Organization\n        is an organization with the aim of promoting knowledge and good\n        practices about software development, and more specifically around\n        frontend, backend, cloud, devops, machine learning, and other\n        technologies. The Organization cares deeply about your privacy. We\n        strive to protect the privacy and the confidentiality of personal data\n        we process. Hence, we do everything in our power to comply with the\n        Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n        of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the\n        processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\n        (hereafter the ‘Regulation’) or any applicable data protection\n        legislation (hereinafter collectively with the Regulation referred to as\n        the ‘Data Protection Law’). The words ‘personal data’, ‘controller’,\n        ‘processor’, ‘process’, ‘processing’, ‘profiling’, ‘data subject’ and\n        all its derivatives used in this Privacy Declaration shall have the\n        meaning set out in the Regulation.\n      </p>\n      <h3>1. Identity of the controller and contact details</h3>\n      <p>\n        Conferencia DevBcn SL as organizer of the DevBcn is the controller of\n        the personal data that is used to organize the conference and related\n        activities.\n      </p>\n      <h3>2. The personal data we collect and process</h3>\n      <p>Personal data collected falls under the following main categories:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Identification data (e.g. name, surname, id card…)</li>\n        <li>Contact data (e.g. email address…)</li>\n        <li>Financial data (e.g. bank account number, VAT number…)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        These personal data may relate to you in your capacity as a customer or\n        supplier of The Organization and DevBcn, but also to you as a business\n        relationship of one of our clients, and/or as one of the attendees of\n        our conferences. We collect and process personal data that you provide\n        to us directly (e.g. by sending a proposal or buying a ticket).\n        Occasionally we may as well collect contact data through another route,\n        for example via a public source or provided by one of our clients,\n        sponsors or attendees. We do not use automated data processing (e.g.\n        activity analysis) or so-called\n        <em>“profiling” that may involve the generation of derivative data.</em>\n      </p>\n      <h3>3. Purposes of and legal basis for the processing personal data</h3>\n      <h4>3.1. In General</h4>\n      <p>\n        We process your personal data for various purposes, including conducting\n        our general and financial administration, the organization of our\n        (future) conferences, to keep you updated about our (future)\n        conferences, managing our customer and supplier base, providing a\n        correct service and the proper execution of our agreements and direct\n        marketing activities (e.g. sending newsletters). Article 6.1 of the\n        Regulation indicates the legal grounds on the basis of which personal\n        data may be processed. Below we give you a brief overview of the legal\n        grounds we rely on for the processing of personal data. Your personal\n        data may be processed: Based upon your consent: we process personal data\n        based upon your explicit and specific consent. Your consent is freely\n        given and can be withdrawn at any moment. For compliance with a legal\n        obligation to which we are subject to: we have to comply with various\n        legal obligations, under which we are obliged to maintain specific\n        (personal) data. For the performance of a contract to which you are a\n        party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a\n        contract: to execute our agreements, it’s necessary to process personal\n        data. We hereby always limit ourselves to processing the data that are\n        strictly necessary.\n      </p>\n      <h4>3.2. Attending our conferences</h4>\n      <p>\n        Organization of the DevBcn requires a lot of administration.\n        Nevertheless we try to keep it very simple for our attendees.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Buying an entrance ticket for one of our conferences Registering for\n          one of our conferences takes only a few steps. First of all we ask you\n          to fill in an online form. In this form we ask you for several types\n          of personal data, like identification data (name, surname, company\n          you’re connected to) and contact details (address, email address) of\n          the attendee(s). For the avoidance of the doubt, if a third party buys\n          a ticket for someone else (e.g. an employer for its employees) we will\n          ask and process data from the attendees for whom a ticket will be\n          bought. After you’ve been registered, we will ask you to pay for your\n          entrance ticket(s). Therefore, we may ask you for your bank account\n          number, card number, name of the card holder, the due date of the\n          card, VAT number… The processing of these data is a necessary step\n          prior to entering into a contract with us. Without the processing of\n          these data you will be unable to attend (one of) our conferences.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Sharing your personal data with the exhibitors DevBcn (through its\n          mobile app) facilitates attendees to freely share their identification\n          and contact information with sponsors. This does not include any\n          financial information or additional data than the one provided during\n          ticket acquisition. Attendees choose the sponsors we share their\n          personal data with. At the entrance of DevBcn conference attendees\n          receive a QR-Code. The sponsors are able to scan this QR-code which\n          contains the information. Attendees are responsible for requiring each\n          one of the sponsors they interact with the respective data policies.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>3.3. Direct marketing activities</h4>\n      <p>\n        We also process personal data for reasons of direct marketing. We deem\n        it to be one of our legitimate interests to communicate with our\n        customers (e.g. attendees, speakers, sponsors, providers…). Therefore,\n        we may send you information about our products, services and future\n        conferences if we consider you as a part of our customer base. This will\n        be the case if you visited one of our previous conferences, or if you\n        contacted us by mail or subscribed to our newsletter, or if you’re a\n        customer of one of our business relationships. If you no longer want to\n        receive our communications, you can unsubscribe by clicking the\n        unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of any marketing email we send\n        to you and following the instructions which appear in your browser\n        following your clicking on that link.\n      </p>\n      <h3>4. Who has access to your personal data?</h3>\n      <p>\n        Only a limited number of the conference staff have direct access to the\n        personal data we’ve collected and processed, and are bound to\n        confidentiality.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The Organization does not share your personal data with third parties\n        for any other purpose than mentioned in this Privacy Declaration, unless\n        when we are required to do so by law or for the purposes of prevention\n        of fraud or other crime.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We do however pass your information to our third party service\n        providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organizations for\n        the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our\n        behalf (e.g. email communication, payment processing, back-up storage…).\n        We only discloses the essential personal data to its sub-processors that\n        are necessary for the execution of their services.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If we transfer personal data to countries outside the EEA, we will, in\n        all circumstances, take appropriate safeguards and establish legal\n        grounds justifying such transfer.\n      </p>\n      <h3>5. How long do we keep your personal data?</h3>\n      <p>\n        We keep your personal data as long as required to comply with our legal\n        obligations and to provide our services in a correct manner or because\n        we have a legitimate interest to keep your personal data. At any moment\n        you have the possibility to object against further processing of your\n        personal data.\n      </p>\n      <h3>6. How do we protect your personal data?</h3>\n      <p>\n        The Organization takes appropriate measures to prevent misuse, loss,\n        unauthorized access, unwanted disclosure and unauthorized modification.\n        If you have the impression that your data is not properly secured or\n        there are indications of abuse, please contact our customer service or\n        via{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"mailto:customers@devbcn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n          customers@devbcn.com.\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n        7. What rights do you have regarding the processing of your personal\n        data?\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        The Regulation provides you with various rights regarding the processing\n        of your personal data.

You can ask for the data to be\n        corrected or completed at any time.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Right to erasure: you can ask to erase the personal data that we’ve\n        collected and process about you (‘right to be forgotten’). We may deny\n        this request if further processing of this personal data is needed to\n        comply with a legal obligation, for the executing of a contract or to\n        protect our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of our\n        clients, suppliers or those of a third party.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Right to data portability: you are entitled to ask for personal data\n        that you have provided The Organization (in relation to DevBcn) to be\n        transferred back to you or to a third party.
