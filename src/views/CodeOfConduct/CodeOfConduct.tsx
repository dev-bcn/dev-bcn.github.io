            <h4>1. Purpose</h4>
            <p>
              Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
              gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
              disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
              religion (or lack thereof), ideology, choice of technology, sexual
              images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
              following, photographic harassment or recording, sustained
              disruption of conversations, inappropriate physical contact and
              unwanted sexual attention. We expect participants who are asked to
              stop any harassing behavior to comply immediately. If a
              participant engages in harassing behavior, conference organizers
              may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or
              expulsion from the conference. If you are being harassed, observe
              that someone else is being harassed or have comments about
              harassment, please contact the conference organizing team
              immediately or ask the technical staff for us. Event staff will
              help participants contact venue organizers, provide escorts, or
              help those who are being harassed feel safe during the conference.
              We expect participants to follow these rules both during DevBcn
              and at related social events. This code of conduct outlines our
              expectations for all those participating in DevBcn both online and
              offline, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Expected behavior</h4>

            <p>
              The following behavior is expected and requested from all
              participants of the event:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Participate in an authentic and active manner.</li>
              <li>
                Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
              </li>
              <li>Seek collaboration rather than conflict.</li>
              <li>
                Respect that people have differences of opinion and that there
                is rarely one right answer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask about gender rather than assuming, and if you get it wrong,
                apologize and use the gender pronoun they prefer. (Please note
                that continuing to misgender is harassment).
              </li>
              <li>
                Please note that by attending our events, you are subject to
                being photographed or videotaped. If you wear a "No photos or
                video" sticker the official photographer will take that into
                account for closeup pictures.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Unacceptable behavior</h4>

            <p>

                Posting or threatening to post personally identifiable

              <li>

              <li>
                Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual

              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Inappropriate physical contact. They must have someone's verbal
                consent before touching them. Dressing or acting in a certain
                way is not consent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unwanted sexual attention. This includes sexual comments or

              <li>
                Sustained disruption of community events, including lectures and
                presentations.
              </li>
              <li>Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Consequences of unacceptable behavior</h4>

            <p>
              If a participant behaves inappropriately, the organizers of DevBcn
              may take whatever action they deem necessary, including warning
              the offending person or expulsion from the Conference. If you are
              being harassed, see or perceive that someone else is being
              harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the
              organizers immediately. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior
              is expected to comply immediately. Please remember that mistakes
              happen, you are not a bad person, just re-evaluate your behavior
              and do better next time.

              soon as possible. If you do not feel comfortable speaking to an
              organizer, please feel free to send your concerns or any comments
